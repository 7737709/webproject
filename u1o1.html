    <div> <br> <h3>1.1) Describe the pupose of it in modern business.</h3>
    <p>Utilizing IT in business is very important in today’s modern age. There are so many different kinds of software out there that can help your business operate and collaborate better. For example, you have Trello a great tool to delegate jobs and tasks to your team, Slack a great place to communicate with your team and so many other IT solutions that can help your business significantly. By utilising IT solutions you enable your team to work more effectively.</p> </div>


    <br> <h3>1.2) Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
    <p>I find the key features to a successful project are making sure you have a decent team management setup/protocol and most importantly having up to date modern IT equipment. Additionally to that I would make sure that people in the team AKA developers aren’t just capable of making the end product but have the skills to work in a team, communicate and delegate. </p>


    <br> <h3> 1.3) Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3>
    <p>For starters I would use software like Trello to manage the project, so with that I can create, edit, comment, and in some cases delegate tasks. Being able to go to one place and be able to see everything that is going on is the most efficient way of running a project. For the actual planning of the project/website, depending on the scale of the project I would put either use my head to remember or put it on paper and then fill out a Trello board with all the different task under a series of columns with details and descriptions for each card/task.</p>


    <br> <h3> 1.4) Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
    <p>There are a number of risks when working with digital projects, one of them being the fact that you might rely on every team member. By working with a team you rely on every team member to do their part. For example, if for whatever reason you need a specific member to do a specific task so that you can move forward with another phase or complete the project and that specific member cannot perform that tasks at that time then everything stalls. Secondly, you also have the issue of having your work being hacked or being infected by a virus. If for whatever reason your work gets hacked it can jeopardize your entire project, and the same goes if your work gets infected by a virus it'll put everything on the line.</p>


    <br> <h3> 1.5) Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
    <p>Using the word correct or right in the technology world isn't really fair because there are so many options out there that there can be multiple solutions for one problem. However, the way I would go to choose the IT systems and software would be based on recommendations. With the power of Google, I would research what I need and based on review and recommendations choose the viable solution. By doing that it doesn't mean that the solution I choose is right however it also doesn't mean that I'm wrong.</p>


    <br> <h3> 1.6) Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h3>
    <p>Trello has a massive part in our projects, it lets us separate our tasks from backlog, to-do, in progress, in review and done. Without Trello everything would be unorganized and we'd never meet our deadlines.  Github helps us keep the latest version of code afloat and available for any developer to download and edit whilst making sure that no one else is editing the code at that time, therefore, preventing us from unnecessary complications.</p>


    <br> <h3> 1.7) Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
    <p>When it comes to the legal side of stuff in the digital world things start to become complicated. You have the general rules and regulations and then you have privacy rules and GDPR. Not having your website GDPR compliant can cause you massive issues and if your not careful can be really easy to in to. For example: "At its core, GDPR is a new set of rules designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data. It aims to simplify the regulatory environment for business so both citizens and businesses in the European Union can fully benefit from the digital economy."
