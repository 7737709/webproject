<br> <h3> 1.1) Describing the content and layout for each page.</h3>
<p>I decided to structure my website by having a separate page for Outcome. So I made one page for Unit 1, Outcome 1 and another for Unit 1, Outcome 2, etc. 
    Each page/outcome displays the question and then the shows answer and the same for all outcomes. For the About me/home page I have spoken a little bit about my life journey and how I am where I am today.</p>


<br> <h3> 1.5) Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
<p>It is very important to make sure you do not have any copyright protected content within your site. Copyrighted content can be anything from a picture to just a small article. Having copyrighted content on your site will make you vulnerable to legal issues. Other than that, having content on your site that is already on others won't help the ranking of your site as search engines will see the same content on both sites and therefore display both in your keyword results.</p>


<br> <h3> 1.6) Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>
<p>According to new government data, there are now 13.9 million disabled people in the UK. Unfortunately, there are various disabilities that need taking into account when creating a website. Unfortunately, people who suffer from sight loss, dyslexia, hearing problems, etc.  have difficulties using websites. We can help the impaired by having an option to switch the site to a larger font, dyslexia font and even read out selected part of the site for them. <br> <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/there-are-now-nearly-14-million-disabled-people-in_uk_5ac61b74e4b01f556d5658d4" target="_blank"> </p> As seen in Huffington Post </a>


<br> <h3> 1.7) Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
<p>With websites you can practically use any kind fo filetype, anything you click on a website is a link to another file. So as long as it will display in a browser you can link it up. It gets slightly more complicated when you are looking to embed files with the code. By Vangie Beal, When designing a Web page, an embedded file refers to any type of multimedia file that you might insert, or embed into the Web page. This includes files like graphics and sound files.</p>
