    <br> <h3>2.1) Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>
    <p>..................................................</p>


    <br> <h3>2.2) Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello etc.</h3>
    <p>The IT tools that code nation introduced us to and encouraged us to use were in my opinion, an excellent choice. Using Visual Studio to edit my code files was a great experience. Before the course, I had used Notepad ++ and after using VS code there is no chance that I'm going back to notepad. Moving on from VS code and going to Trello and Slack, although two completely different platforms they both helped me with my communication and maintaining full clarity for the duration of the project.</p>

    <br> <h3> 2.3) Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects - what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of slack?</h3>
    <p>..........................................</p>


    <br> <h3>2.4) Describe further improvments you can make to your project.</h3>
    <p>My project is not the best, and like everything in life will never be the best. There's always something someone else did better and something I could have done better. I could have linked my page with references so that for every question you click for the answers and it scrolls you down the page or even used a variety of different fonts within my site.</p>
