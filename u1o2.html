    <br> <h3>2.1) Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>
    <p>Using VS code has been a great experience for me, I had used Notepad++ in the past and it is rubbish compared to VS Code. In general, I am happy with the tools used on this assignment, this includes Slack, Trello & VS Code however in future projects I personally would use  Asana over Trello. Asana has a few extra features, one of the major one being it lets you use sub tasks.</p>


    <br> <h3>2.2) Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello etc.</h3>
    <p>The IT tools that code nation introduced us to and encouraged us to use were in my opinion, an excellent choice. Using Visual Studio to edit my code files was a great experience. Before the course, I had used Notepad ++ and after using VS code there is no chance that I'm going back to notepad. Moving on from VS code and going to Trello and Slack, although two completely different platforms they both helped me with my communication and maintaining full clarity for the duration of the project.</p>

    <br> <h3> 2.3) Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects - what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of slack?</h3>
    <p>My site has its pros and cons. It's colorful and has a nice menu bar. What it doesn't have is a sitemap or a footer on the bottom. In general, I'm happy with the site however I think had I had more time I could have polished it up more. I would display the text in a bit more of a nicer format and add a footer with a sitemap and so on.</p>


    <br> <h3>2.4) Describe further improvments you can make to your project.</h3>
    <p>My project is not the best, and like everything in life will never be the best. There's always something someone else did better and something I could have done better. I could have linked my page with references so that for every question you click for the answers and it scrolls you down the page or even used a variety of different fonts within my site.</p>
    <br> <h3>2.5) Review outcomes to make sure they match the requirements and are fit for purpose.</h3>
    <p>Once my site was done as a last step I had to go through it and test it to make sure it met all the requirements. I did so by using going through all the questions, code and files to make sure everything meets the expected standards and runs smoothly. Once that was done I uploaded it to Github.com which gave me some errors. One example is that for my favicon to display I had to adjust the code slightly to work with the Github system. Once all those small things were fixed and everything was displaying and working I was ready to submit the link.</p>
