    <br><p class="me">Hi there, my name is Joe Leitner and I am part-time working and part-time studying. A little bit about myself, I started off by messing around with websites back in 2016 and since then I have been creating websites for clients around the world. A few months back I decided that it was time I got to know some code, and then I went through the process of finding code nation and that's how I’m here today!</p>
