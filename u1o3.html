    <br> <h3>3.1) Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency - could you have been more efficient when making your website? How Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
    <p>Using Trello increased my productivity and any efficiency for the duration of the project. Whether working by myself or with a team, Trello helps me break down my project into many different tasks and within that lets me attach any relevant data, such as comments, files, due dates, etc. This helped me be a lot more productive and work in a more efficient way.</p>


    <br> <h3>3.2) Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h3>
    <p>Improving productivity and efficiency can be done in so many ways and varies based on everyone's approach and opinions. I feel that I could have worked more efficiently and have been more productive had I worked on a dual monitor pc setup rather than using a laptop plugged into an additional monitor.</p>


    <br> <h3> 3.3) Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects - what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of slack?</h3>
    <p>Improving productivity is not an easy thing. For me to improve I would continue to use slack but structure the channels in a more productive way. I personally think that having slack channels is absolutely awesome but you have to set it up in a way that you aren't going to be looking all over for one little snippet or piece of information. To do so I would have a different channel for every different category, so instead of having just "#codesharing" I would have "#menucode", "#asciiartcode" and so on. Sp whatever project I'm doing I can always go back and have a look for a snippet of code for a specific thing.</p>


    <br> <h3> 3.4) Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions?</h3>
    <p>Testing digital solutions is all trial and error. You just have to try your product every possible method in order to successfully test it. And even when you test it, if it's run in a different program/software/version or run on a different device things may work/display differently. My opinion with testing is, you can try it out in every possible method there will always be the one that you missed out that may potentially not display the results you want it to.</p>
